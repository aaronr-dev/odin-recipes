        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Juice your oranges, either using a juicer, or by hand through a sieve to catch seeds and pulp. Place the fresh orange juice in the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>When you’re ready to serve, fill each of five champagne flutes—or wine glasses, or plain old cups—about one-third of the way with fresh orange juice. Add a tiny pinch of salt to each. Carefully open the bottle of sparkling wine, and, pouring slowly against the inside of the flute, fill each flute the rest of the way.</li>
                <li>Garnish each drink with a quarter-wheel of orange or a twist.</li>
            </ol>
