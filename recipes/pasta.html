        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Kosher Salt</li>
                <li>1 heaping cup dry short cut pasta (shells or elbows)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon everything bagel spice</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Season generously with salt. Cook the pasta for 8 to 9 minutes, until cooked through (we like it a little past al dente for the comfort food factor).</li>
                <li>Remove the pot from the heat and drain the pasta. Add the butter to the still hot pot, then add the drained pasta on top and toss until the butter is mostly melted.</li>
                <li>Crack the egg right into the pasta. Working quickly, stir vigorouslyâ€”the egg will cook from the heat of the pasta and create a glossy sauce. If your pasta has lost too much heat and the egg still looks raw, simply cook over low heat and continue to stir until the egg has cooked a tiny bit more.</li>
                <li>Spoon the pasta into bowls and sprinkle with the everything bagel spice.</li>
            </ol>
